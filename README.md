# DoNotLink

See donotlink in action at [donotlink.it](https://donotlink.it)

## Description

Donotlink is a simple and fast url shortener that blocks search engines from following links and removes the referer.  
Linking to websites via donotlink will not improve the sites position in search engines.

## API
send a POST request to https://donotlink.it/api
```
POST /api
url=http://example.com

{
  "url": "http:\/\/example.com",
  "code": "Y5Yn",
  "donotlink": "https:\/\/donotlink.it\/Y5Yn"
}
```

## Installation - Apache

Donotlink requires a database (MySQL or MariaDB) and PHP 7.

### Apache

Create a database and set up the redirect table as specified in the **donotlink.sql** file.  
Copy the src directory to the root directory of your domain. Edit the **config.inc.php** file accordingly.  
You are ready to go.  
If you do not use donotlink under the root of your domain, **.htaccess** redirects and **robots.txt** rules will not work anymore.
