   <h2>Something's wrong here...</h2>

   <p>Uh oh, <?php echo SITE_NAME; ?> couldn't find a link for the URL you clicked. <br />
   Most <?php echo SITE_NAME; ?> URLs are 4-6 characters, only include letters and numbers (and are case sensitive) (e.g. <?php echo SERVER_NAME; ?>/zxwL) or have another URL appended (e.g. <?php echo SERVER_NAME; ?>/http://example.com). <br />
